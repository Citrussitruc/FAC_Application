            </p>
            <p> 
                > I’m passionate about everything bikes, from riding to repairing and building, I have spent the last two years volunteering at various community bike shops from 
                    <a href="http://recyclistas.ca">Recyclistas</a> in Victoria BC to 
                    <a href="https://santropolroulant.org/en/what-is-the-roulant/collectives/santrovelo/">Santrovelo</a> in Montreal QC.

            <p> 
                > I’ve always been curious in how things work from the mechanics in bikes and now more recently to coding.
            </p>
            <p>
                > Coding is something that I first attempted to learn when I was 14 where I attempted to build an RPG in processing and now years later I have come back to.
            </p
            <p>    
                > During my time in Montreal particularly, I took part in a French course for newcomers to Quebec and being in such a diverse learning community inspired me hugely. I started learning some coding, following online tutorials and resources and built a basic <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/citrussitruc/present/eQurKHGg9">game</a> using the P5Js library.
                Upon returning to the UK I wanted to find a community which could focus my learning and help me reach that next step.
