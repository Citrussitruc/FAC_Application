# FAC_Application

Hi, thanks for taking a look at my application.

I've learned so much in the process of making this and really apreciate the chance to apply.

Not quite sure of the reason, but some of the colours and stylings appear differently in the GitHub pages, than on my IDE.

Oh and I've seen a bug where the carousel breaks, when I refresh it again it usually fixes itself.
